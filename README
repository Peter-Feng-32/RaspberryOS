Current step:

Write a GPIO driver to be able to read/write GPIO pins. - Done
Going to use this to talk with the computer using the UART device. - Done

Now we implement XMODEM for file transfer.

Then we write a utility to talk to our raspberry pi (ttywrite)

After that, we can implement a shell with hard coded 'echo'.  Store arguments as a stack vector.  Make a console.
