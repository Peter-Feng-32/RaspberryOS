Todo: basic memory allocator

Not sure why scheduler is broken.  Check memory addresses and make sure we are doing the correct things.  May need to gdb.
Switching seems to bring us to the wrong place.  Memory alignment issue?  Use gdb to check what we're actually storing and loading on context switch.
