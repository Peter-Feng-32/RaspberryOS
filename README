Current step:

Write a GPIO driver to be able to read/write GPIO pins. - Done
Going to use this to talk with the computer using the UART device. - Done

Now we implement XMODEM for file transfer - Done

Then we write a utility to talk to our raspberry pi (ttywrite) - Not needed w/ emulator.  Skip for now. 

After that, we can implement a shell with hard coded 'echo'.  Store arguments as a stack vector.  Make a console.

Todo: 
Add commands to generate linker map file and dependency files.
